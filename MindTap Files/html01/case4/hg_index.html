          <strong>Welcome to Harpe Gaming</strong>. We have a simple philosophy.
          It has three main points:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Unplug
          </li>
          <li>
            Interact
          </li>
          <li>
            Reconnect
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          And that's it. We believe that the best games are the ones that bring
          people together through shared experiences. With all due respect to
          our video gamer friends, you can't always get that from a computer
          screen. Sometimes you need the intimate approach of sitting
          face-to-face around a common table with the soda and chips at your
          elbow.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are a local board and card game store located in the heart of
          Morgantown near the campus. We carry hundreds of games and puzzles,
          including educational games, family games, card games, historical
          simulations, role-playing games, and so much more. If you remember a
          great game from your youth, we probably have it in our antiques
          collection. If we don't, we know where we can get it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're more than just a place to buy games. We celebrate gaming and the
          company of good friends. Our game room is free for all to us. Sit
          down, pick out a game from our demo library and start playing. We
          sponsor tournaments, challenges, and special social events. You'll
          always find a game to play.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're always on the lookout for the best new games. We publish
          periodic reviews of new titles. Just out our reviews of
          <em>Towers and Temples</em> and <em>Alliance</em>; both new this month
          at Harpe Gaming.
