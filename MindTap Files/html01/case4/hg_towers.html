        <h2>
          Rule an Ancient City
        </h2>
        <p>
          <cite>Towers and Temples</cite> is the winner of the 2017 Palmer Medal
          for <em>Best New Simulation Board Game</em>. Players adopt role cards
          of characters from ancient Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage the
          administration of a city. Each role provides a different ability and
          strategy. However, one role card belongs to a deadly assassin and
          players must be constantly aware of betrayal and double-cross. This
          card game provides a ton of enjoyment and can handle up to eight
          players and expansion packs available for larger parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must carefully
          choose his or her roles and the strategies can quickly change with the
          turn of a card. However the level of randomness is just right and
          cunning and resourcefulness can overcome bad luck (if given time.) I
          do not recommend this game unless there are at least 4 players; less
          than that reduces the intrigue and some of the game appeal.

          <p>
            <cite>Towers and Temples</cite> is a great game. The balance is just
            about perfect and each player must carefully choose roles each turn.
            Even though the strategic possibilities are nearly endless, the game
            is simple to learn. The replay value is high and gets even better
            when you replace some of the cards with new cards available in the
            expansion packs.

            Great Strategic Board Game
          </h3>
          <p>
            We tested <cite>Towers and Temples</cite> with everything from 2 to
            6 players and we can strongly recommend the game. The different
            phases of the game are interesting and intriguing, from bluffing and
            stealing to site construction and planning. With the variety of
            cards and scenarios, no two games are ever quite the same. It's a
            great introduction to the world of strategic board games and role
            playing.

          <h3>
            An Incredible Game
          </h3>
          <p>
            The artwork on the cards and the board is excellent and one of the
            best around. As for play, this game offers lots of strategy, and
            there are tough decisions to make every turn. It's not only
            important to select the character that increases your chances for
            scoring, but also to anticipate the characters the opponents are
            likely to select, and then hedge against their availability. This
            causes a lot of unpredictability and deep strategic thinking.
            However, it can still be played at a more basic level for younger
            users.
          </p>
          <p>
            We had a lot of fun with this game and rate it as
            <strong>Best in its Class</strong>. Highly recommended.
