        <h2>
          Decide the Fate of the World
        </h2>
        <p>
          <cite>Alliance</cite> challenges you and your opponents to decide the
          outcome. As one of the world powers battling for supremacy you must
          lead your country's military drive; but you can't do it alone. You
          have to form <cite>Alliance</cite>s and then betray your allies before
          they betray you!
        </p>
        <p>
          Decide where to strike, when to strike, and the intensity of the
          strike. Will it be a bombing raid, an offshore missile barrage, or an
          invasion with land forces and tanks? Plan your attack, move into enemy
          territory with your forces and win the conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
          The economic destiny of your nation is also at stake. Buy armaments
          and develop secret weapons from your country's economic funds and
          natural reserves, but be sure to save something for the future.

            Tedious and Confusing
          </h3>
          <p>
            The list of war simulation games is long. All of them share similar
            features including the formation of temporary
            <cite>Alliance</cite> and battles simulated through random draws of
            a deck or the roll of the die. <cite>Alliance</cite> offers very
            little that is new or innovative in that regard.
          </p>
          <p>
            We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing. In fact, I dare
            say we spent more time reading and rereading the rule book than
            actually playing the game. If you want to read a book on war, we
            suggest <cite>Sun Tzu</cite>.

          <h3>
            Decent Game but Many are Better
          </h3>
          <p>
            <cite>Alliance</cite> is a good war simulation game. We found the
            game play to be robust and engaging. The rules are long and drawn
            out but, for anyone with experience in this class of board games,
            there is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We think the
            battle simulation cards are some of the best we have encountered.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of that being said, the competition for this type of game is
            fierce. There are a lot of established titles with loyal clients.
            We're not exactly sure where <cite>Alliance</cite> fits in with that
            group. It's a good game, but not good enough to draw our attention
            away from games like <cite>Battle Tested</cite> and
            <cite>Global Conflict</cite>.

            Fun and Challenging
          </h3>
          <p>
            <cite>Alliance</cite> is fun game and is sure to appeal to war game
            enthusiasts. We think it offers several new ideas that we're
            surprised have not been utilized in other simulation games. The card
            system and the investment options give the game a "real world" feel.

              Long and Complicated Rule Book

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is a great game for anyone 16 years or older. Younger players
            may have trouble with the rules and may be bored
